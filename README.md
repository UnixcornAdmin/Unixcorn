Unixcorn 🦄
Unixcorn is a free, open source Linux distribution built with transgender, nonbinary, and gender fluid users in mind. It is designed to be fun, capable, private, and safe — without sacrificing power for those who want to go deeper.
This is not just another Linux distro. It is a space that sees you.
Vision
Most operating systems treat identity as an afterthought. Unixcorn treats it as a foundation. From first boot, users can choose how they want their system to look and feel — not through gendered labels, but through aesthetic expression. Pronouns, salutations, and daily presentation options are built in, optional, and respected throughout the system.
Privacy and security are not features. They are defaults.
Goals
A modular installation experience — install what you need, nothing you don't. Gaming ready when you want it. Lightweight when you don't. Beautiful always.
Status
Early concept phase. Building the foundation. Contributors welcome.
